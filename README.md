# Application_Engineering_Design

Healthcare Engineering Design is a discipline that applies the design concepts and principles of engineering to medicine. The objective of the healthcare engineering design track is to prepare students with problem solving skills of engineering and appreciable knowledge connecting engineering and medicine fields to advance medical treatment and diagnosis. This course will equip the students with the skillsets in design and analysis of surgical tools, surgical robots, , lifesaving equipment, biomedical instruments for treatment and diagnosis, physiological parameter monitors using sensors, biomechanics (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal), biomedical imaging, medical devices, cell and tissue engineering and more with various medical applications. 


SYSTEMS ENGINEERING CONCEPTS

Systems engineering focuses on the design, control, and orchestration of system activities to meet performance objectives. Before discussing systems engineering tools and applications, we provide some basic definitions and key concepts.

Systems Definition and Operational Behavior
A system is a set of possibly diverse entities (patients, nurses, physicians, etc.), each performing some set of functions. The interaction of these entities as they perform their various functions gives rise to a global system behavior.

System State, Resources, and Customers
The state of a system is an instantaneous snapshot of its status. For example, the state of a medical/surgical unit in a hospital might indicate that room 210 is occupied by patient 0901, wheelchair 11 is idle, and nurse 21 is on break. Thus, room 210 is allocated to a patient, wheelchair 11 is available for allocation, and nurse 21 is not currently available. Many levels of resolution are possible in specifying the information content of the system state.

System Operation, Event Occurrence, and State Evolution
As a system operates, it moves from one state to the next through the occurrence of enabled events. An event is enabled when the preconditions for its occurrence are met. An event occurs when its associated actions are performed. For example, if an ICU has 30 beds, with 29 occupied and one available, and there is a patient in the emergency department requesting an ICU bed, then an ICU bed allocation event is enabled and can be performed. This event is performed when the bed is assigned to the patient. If another patient arrives needing an ICU bed, the ICU bed allocation event is not enabled because a bed is not available.

The sequence of states that the system traverses over some time horizon is referred to as the state trace of the system. There are many system state traces that might possibly evolve and because of the presence of uncontrollable events such as walk-in or ambulance arrivals, the future state trace is not always predictable or controllable.

Making systems that work relies on asking questions to understand the context of the challenge, design a competent system, deliver this system into practice and to sustain its utility and use. Such questions typically focus on complementary perspectives on people, systems, design and risk and range from simple narrative enquiry to detailed engineering analysis and simulation.p
